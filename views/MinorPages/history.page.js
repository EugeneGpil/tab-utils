<h1>A brief History of Time</h1>

<h2>Curiosity, symbolic and strategic moves.</h2>

<p>
<b>The first adoption</b> of a standard time was on December 1, 1847, in Great Britain by railway companies using GMT kept by portable chronometers. The first of these companies to adopt standard time was the Great Western Railway (GWR) in November 1840. This quickly became known as Railway Time.
</p>

<p>
The <b>first person</b> known to conceive a world time zone system was the Italian mathematician Quirico Filopanti. He introduced the idea in 1858 in his book Miranda! He proposed 24 time zones, which he called "longitudinal days", the first centered on the meridian of Rome.
</p>

<p>
From 1940 to 1947, <b>UK</b> was not under its usual Greenwich Mean Time (UTC + 0). When British daylight saving time ended in 1940, the clocks were not put back an hour, so they remained at UTC+1 and the following spring the clocks were put again an hour ahead at UTC+2. The change meant that Britain stayed outside of its normal time zone during the <b>World War II</b>, with up to two hours of extra daylight at the end of the day. The government strategy was to support the war effort saving fuel and giving workers extra time to go home before the blackout began.

<p>
In 2007, <b>Venezuela's</b> president Hugo Chavez shifted the entire country back 30 minutes. 
</p>

<p>
Historically <b>France</b> used to be on Paris time, nine minutes ahead of GMT. But the country is now GMT+1.
</p>

<p>
On Aug. 15, 2015, <b>North Korean</b> leader Kim Jong Un decided to put clocks back half an hour to establish their own time zone, “Pyongyang time” differentiating from South Korea. About three years later, the change has been reversed as a sign of reconciliation and collaboration.

<h2>When we change our clocks – Europe vs U.S.A.</h2>

<p>
Most of the <b>United States</b> starts Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m. on the second Sunday of March and returns to Standard Time on the first Sunday of November. In the United States, each time zone changes at a different time.
</p>

<p>
In the <b>European Union</b>, daylight saving time (summer time) starts and ends at 01:00 a.m. Universal Time (GMT). It starts on the last Sunday of March and ends on the last Sunday of October. In the EU, all time zones change at the same time.
</p>


<h2>Main Timezones</h2>

<p>
<b>UTC</b> (or GMT) is the "<b>Universal Coordinated Time</b>", which corresponds to the Greenwich Time zone. At this point meridian 0 has been placed. When the sun is exactly at the peak of the meridian line or longitudinal zenith, it is 12 o'clock. The old acronym GMT, which means "Greenwich mean time", has given way to UTC. The new system is based on atomic clocks and no longer on celestial phenomena.
</p>

<p>
<b>CET</b> is the “<b>Central Europe time</b>”. It is set one hour ahead of the coordinated universal time (UTC+1) when standard time is in effect. All European countries abandon it in the summer, switching to the UTC+2 time zone called Central European Summer Time.
</p>

<p>
<b>EST</b> is the “<b>Eastern Standard Time</b>”. It is the time zone of the east coast of the United States and Canada, corresponding to UTC-5. In the summer it becomes EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) or UTC-4.
</p>

<p>
<b>PST</b> is the “<b>Pacific Standard Time</b>”. It is the time zone of the west coast of the United States and Canada, which in the summer becomes Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).
